My daughters had some problems reading the clock this year, so like any good father I sat down with them and did some exercises.
Just kidding. Like any good nerd I sat down with my laptop and wrote an application to train reading the clock.
While I was at it I took the opportunity to dip my toes into the VR world. It was quite a fun experience, and I learned a few details about react along the way, which is nice.
